some hints on_hover for
    - Save blinking
    - Reload blinking
    - mod has orange or red background

better mod info - kinda done, probably could be better
dark mode - kinda done, could use some improvements
sort button - done, but improve the dialog with missing mods to allow to load them if in inactive list
indicator if mod is missing prerequisites - kinda done with just color
better check for new mods instead of periodic call

fix do not check workshop mods if Kenshi folder is not managed by Steam but at the same time Steam Kenshi workshop folder exists
proper save file parser to get the used mods

a mod also has a list of "references", Iam not sure what is the purpose and it may be important to handle

Shift+arrowUp/Down should select multiple mods - somehow I failed to implement this (as of v1.0.0)

remember in config the last window size used and then set it on load

fix listbox width

add ability to drag-and-drop mods between listboxes
