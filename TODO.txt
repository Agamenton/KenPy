some hints on_hover for
    - Save blinking
    - Reload blinking
    - mod has orange or red background

better mod info - kinda done, probably could be better
dark mode - kinda done, could use some improvements
sort button - done, but improve the dialog with missing mods to allow to load them if in inactive list
indicator if mod is missing prerequisites - kinda done with just color
better check for new mods instead of periodic call

fix do not check workshop mods if Kenshi folder is not managed by Steam but at the same time Steam Kenshi workshop folder exists
